Jay Carter, what you got for me?

Alien-ass
Niggas stuck inside a box, they don't know what they should do
They got people downplaying 'em, so depression is they mood
I can't tell you how to live your life 'cause I ain't in your shoes
But I can give you a couple hacks to have your way and work your move
First you get three, four of them unsecureds and put 'em on your pro
Then you let 'em build for a couple months, then order up some more
I'm tryin' to put you down on knowledge
There's some shit don't want you to know
I'm tryin' to take you out the hood and
Take you places they don't want you to go
You niggas crash and burn your credit
Get you a hundred and start a biz
Most these niggas who tell you not to, in reality, ain't got shit
Tried to put them S on, but there was too much disagreement
You gotta dictate your surroundings, you gotta be very strategic
Don't just sit around and hate on niggas who really havin' M's
If you been broke for ten years or
Longer, you need some better friends
Don't you ever grab no losses, learn to take it on the chin
'Fore I ever go dead broke, I'll go and purchase me a Benz
Why the fuck you strong on robbin' when you can swindle institutions?
You can make millions from the shit
That petty crime you do is stupid
Every method that I had, I took that shit and I abused it
I would really strike for jewelry 'fore I started doin' music
Ain't none of these rappers on my
Level, I can really change your life
Every postage check I get, I spend it on some brand new pipes
If you from the bottom and tryin' to get out, then me and you alike
I can put the streets on M, that's
Somethin' the government do not like
